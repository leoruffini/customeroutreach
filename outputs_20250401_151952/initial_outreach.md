Dear Tomasz Walenczak,

I hope this message finds you well. I have been following the impressive work at Manpower Group Poland, particularly in adapting to the post-pandemic market challenges. I understand that the significant talent shortage, especially in critical thinking, adaptability, and analytical skills, continues to be a pressing issue.

Given this context, I wanted to introduce InfoPraca.pl’s AI-powered recruitment platform. Since 2005, we have been transforming recruitment processes in the Polish market by providing solutions that streamline candidate screening and matching through our Jobby assistant, significantly reducing time-to-hire.

Our platform not only enhances efficiency in hiring but also improves the quality of hire. By leveraging AI-driven insights, your team can identify high-quality candidates more effectively, directly addressing the skills shortages highlighted in your Employment Outlook Surveys.

We have helped numerous similar organizations realize noticeable improvements, both in time savings and quality of hire, with our data-driven recruitment strategies. I believe a personalized demo session could demonstrate how our solutions would align with your strategic goals.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further and explore how InfoPraca.pl can become a valuable partner to Manpower Group Poland.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

[Your Name]  
Lead Sales Representative, InfoPraca.pl
