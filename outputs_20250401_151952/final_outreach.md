Subject: Empowering Manpower Group Poland with Enhanced Talent Acquisition

Dear Tomasz,

I hope this message finds you well. Given Manpower Group Poland's pivotal role in navigating talent acquisition amidst evolving challenges, I understand the critical importance of sourcing candidates with skills such as adaptability and critical thinking.

At InfoPraca.pl, we are acutely aware of these challenges, which is why we have developed an AI-powered recruitment solution designed specifically to enhance the quality and efficiency of the hiring process. Our platform has helped businesses not only in mitigating talent shortages but also in reducing the time to hire by up to 30%, freeing up valuable resources for strategic initiatives.

For instance, we recently assisted a leading Polish industrial firm in overcoming their candidate scarcity, resulting in a 25% improvement in critical skills acquisition compared to previous campaigns. I believe our tailored strategies could significantly benefit Manpower Group by bringing similar success in addressing your unique recruitment needs.

I would be thrilled to demonstrate how our solutions can align with your goals in a short demo session. Please let me know a convenient time for you, or feel free to book directly using my calendar link [insert link].

Looking forward to the opportunity to support Manpower Group Poland in achieving your 2023 talent acquisition targets.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]  
Senior Sales Representative
