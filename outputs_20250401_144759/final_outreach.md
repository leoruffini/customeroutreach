Subject: Elevating Manpower Group Poland’s Recruitment Strategy with Targeted AI Solutions

Dear Mr. Walenczak,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently came across Manpower Group Poland's latest achievements and felt compelled to reach out. Congratulations on receiving the Platinum EcoVadis medal in 2023—an accomplishment that not only underscores your commitment to sustainability but also positions your organization among the top 1% globally. It’s impressive how you've steered Manpower Group towards sustainable growth while supporting strategic initiatives like the successful placement of thousands of refugees across Europe.

As Country Manager, your pursuit of excellence in talent acquisition has been evident, especially with the optimistic projections outlined in your latest Employment Outlook Survey. Given these plans, I believe InfoPraca.pl can be a strategic ally in enhancing your recruitment capabilities further.

At InfoPraca.pl, we’ve partnered with industry leaders to transform their hiring processes through our AI-powered solutions. For instance, a recent collaboration with a leading Polish financial firm led to a 30% decrease in hiring time, significantly reducing operational overhead and enabling their team to focus on strategic growth initiatives—a model I envisage could benefit Manpower Group.

Our platform excels in superior candidate-matching capabilities, fine-tuned to the nuances of the Polish market, allowing you to connect with the right talent more efficiently. Additionally, we understand that tailoring our approach is crucial, and we have customizable solutions to complement your ongoing digital transformation journey.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how our innovative solutions can support Manpower Group Poland’s goals. Could we schedule a 30-minute call next week? I’m keen to explore how we might help streamline your recruitment process while enhancing your talent acquisition strategy.

Thank you for considering this potential partnership. I look forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
