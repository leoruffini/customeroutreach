Dear Pawe≈Ç,

I hope this message finds you well and energized by the innovative work you're leading at Manpower Group Poland. Your commitment to initiatives like the ESG integration and the transformative approach through the ServiceNow RiseUp program has not gone unnoticed. It's truly inspiring to see the strides you're making toward digital enhancement and sustainability.

At InfoPraca.pl, we're excited about the possibility of supporting Manpower Group Poland in overcoming recruitment and skill acquisition challenges. Our AI-powered platform is designed not only to streamline the recruitment process but also to enhance the quality of hires in alignment with your digital transformation goals.

Allow me to share a brief example from a similar collaboration. A leading Polish retail company recently partnered with us to tackle their skill gaps and reduce time-to-hire by 30%. Our tailored pilot program provided them with unprecedented access to a diversified pool of talent, resulting in a 20% increase in qualified candidates and significant cost efficiency. We can explore similar customized solutions as we pilot initiatives tailored to fit your specific needs and objectives.

This type of collaboration is more than a business transaction; it's a partnership aimed at elevating your strategic goals. I would be delighted to schedule a short call to discuss how we can tailor a solution that fits seamlessly with Manpower Group Poland's existing frameworks.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. Please let me know when you would be available for a quick introductory conversation or if there is someone on your team we should coordinate with.

Warmest regards,
