Dear Tomasz,

I hope this message finds you well. As the Country Manager for Manpower Group Poland, you undoubtedly face significant challenges amidst the recent talent shortage in Poland, which has seen a 2% increase as reported in the latest ManpowerGroup insights.

Our AI-powered recruitment services, including the Jobby assistant, are designed to streamline your hiring processes, significantly reducing time-to-fill rates while enhancing candidate quality.

In a recent case study, our collaboration with a leading firm in Poland resulted in a 30% improvement in the recruitment cycle, showcasing our capability to drive tangible results even in stringent conditions like those Poland currently faces.

We would be thrilled to explore how we can extend similar success to Manpower Group Poland and help you navigate the complexities of today's employment landscape. Could we schedule a call to discuss this further? I am available for a meeting next week and would be happy to adjust to a time that suits your schedule.
