Dear Tomasz,

I hope this message finds you well.

As the Country Manager for a leader such as Manpower Group Poland, you are undoubtedly aware of the current challenges in acquiring top-tier talent, especially in sectors like Finance and Communications. With talent shortages identified as a pressing concern, I believe there is an opportunity for us to support Manpower Group Poland in refining and elevating your recruitment processes.

At InfoPraca.pl, we have been committed to transforming recruitment across Poland since 2005, and our AI-powered recruitment platform has effectively partnered with organizations facing similar recruitment hurdles. Our solutions automate candidate sourcing, use data-driven insights for optimal talent matching, and significantly enhance hiring accuracy and efficiency.

One of our powerful tools, the Jobby assistant, could streamline your recruitment activities by reducing time-to-hire and improving the quality of candidates, directly addressing the bottlenecks you mentioned in recent reports. By automating routine processes and providing predictive analytics, we can assist Manpower Group Poland in optimizing your workforce planning and acquisition strategies.

Our success stories with companies in analogous industries demonstrate a clear ROI through time savings, improved hire quality, and enhanced resource utilization. I am confident that these outcomes could be replicated and even exceeded at Manpower Group Poland.

I would love to further discuss how InfoPraca.pl can align with your current recruitment objectives and support your team's ongoing growth and success.

Could we schedule a call next week to explore this potential partnership?

Looking forward to the opportunity to work together.
