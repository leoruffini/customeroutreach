Subject: Transforming Manpower Group Poland's Recruitment with Advanced AI Solutions

Dear Tomasz,

I hope this message finds you well. As the Country Manager at Manpower Group Poland, you're no stranger to the complex challenges of recruiting top talent in today's competitive landscape. At InfoPraca.pl, we share your commitment to excellence in talent acquisition and are excited about the possibilities that AI-driven solutions can offer.

Our collaboration with leading organizations in Poland has enabled them to significantly enhance the quality of their hires while reducing time-to-fill by an average of 30%. A recent partnership with [Specific Company Name] resulted in a 40% increase in candidate engagement through tailored AI integration. These successes are a testament to the strategic advantage provided by our tools, specifically designed for the Polish market's unique requirements.

Unlike other generic platforms, our AI technology is not just about automationâ€”it's about intelligently adapting to your specific recruitment needs and providing actionable insights that make a real difference. This differentiation has been key to the positive transformations we've facilitated.

I'd love the opportunity to discuss how we can replicate this success for Manpower Group Poland and align our resources to your goals. Could we set up a 30-minute call next week to explore this further? Please let me know your availability.

Looking forward to the possibility of collaborating with you.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]  
Lead Sales Representative
