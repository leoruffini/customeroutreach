Subject: Elevating Manpower Group Poland's Recruitment Strategy

Hello Paweł,

I hope this message finds you well.

At InfoPraca.pl, we’ve been closely observing the remarkable work of Manpower Group Poland in navigating the complexities of today's recruitment landscape. As you’re acutely aware, 74% of employers, including those in sectors like manufacturing, are experiencing significant skill shortages. This challenge, although daunting, presents a unique opportunity for strategic advancement.

It’s impressive to see Manpower Group Poland’s commitment to integrating ESG initiatives, particularly your efforts to support diverse talents. Coupled with your involvement in digital transformation, such as the ServiceNow RiseUp program, your leadership is clearly steering towards sustainable growth and tech integration – core tenets for future-ready recruitment.

Our AI-powered platform at InfoPraca.pl could be the strategic partner to complement these initiatives. With our advanced matching algorithms, we can help address the skill shortages by efficiently pairing the right candidates to the right roles. Moreover, our automated screening tools can significantly cut down the time-to-hire, a crucial factor in overcoming the current talent scarcity.

We’ve supported similar transitions with other Polish companies, resulting in enhanced recruitment efficiency and better-quality hires. Given your trajectory, these improvements could align perfectly with your goals.

I’d love the opportunity to discuss how a bespoke pilot program could demonstrate potential ROI and fit seamlessly with Manpower Group’s strategic objectives.

Let’s transform recruitment into a key growth lever for your business.

Looking forward to potentially collaborating.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
