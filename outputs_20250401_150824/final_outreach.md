Subject: Transform Your Recruitment Strategy with InfoPraca.pl's AI Solutions

Dear Mr. Walenczak,

I hope this message finds you well, especially as we enter the busy recruitment season in Poland. I wanted to reach out personally to share how InfoPraca.pl has been partnering with leading firms to tackle recruitment challenges similar to those faced by Manpower Group Poland.

Understanding the complexity of the Polish labor market, where approximately 70% of companies, including peers, report significant difficulties in talent acquisition, we've tailored our services to offer impactful solutions. For instance, one of our collaborations led to a 35% reduction in time-to-hire for a client, significantly boosting employee retention and cutting costsâ€”outcomes that resonate with the nuanced demands of Polish recruitment.

I believe our AI-driven Jobby Assistant could be transformative for Manpower Group Poland, enhancing not only the efficiency of your hiring processes but also the quality of candidates. Our approach combines cutting-edge technology with an understanding of local cultural dynamics, ensuring a seamless and engaging recruitment experience.

Could we schedule a personalized workshop or demo session at your convenience? This would enable us to delve deeper into the specifics of how our solutions can cater to your seasonal recruitment strategy, especially as you gear up for the October to December peak.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how we can support Manpower Group Poland in achieving its recruitment goals effectively.

Best regards,
