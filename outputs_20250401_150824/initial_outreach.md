Subject: Enhancing Recruitment Efficiency with AI Solutions at Manpower Group Poland

Dear Mr. Walenczak,

I hope this message finds you well. I have been closely following Manpower Group Poland's pioneering efforts in navigating the challenging recruitment landscape. With the reported 74% of employers facing difficulties in sourcing skilled talent and the need for digital transformation in recruitment, I believe we have significant opportunities for collaboration.

At InfoPraca.pl, we have been transforming the recruitment process for Polish companies since 2005, leveraging our AI-powered recruitment solutions to address talent scarcity effectively. Our platform provides data-driven insights and helps automate routine tasks, ensuring that your recruiters can focus on personal engagement with high-quality candidates. One of our standout features, the Jobby Assistant, can manage preliminary applicant screenings efficiently, reducing workload and enhancing the hiring experience.

Our AI solutions not only expedite the recruitment cycle but also improve the quality of hires, providing an excellent return on investment through time savings and enhanced recruitment outcomes.

I'd like to share how similar organizations have successfully implemented our tools. We believe that our proven track record in the Polish market aligns well with your strategic objectives, particularly in light of the predicted increase in recruitment efforts from October to December 2023.

Would you be open to a consultation where we could explore customizing our platform to meet Manpower Group's specific needs? I am confident we can provide a solution tailored to your unique challenges, allowing you to stay at the forefront of recruitment innovation.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to the possibility of working together.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]  
Lead Sales Representative
